# Wasteland Project

Project of the subject Programming II at the European University of the Atlantic.
The project consists of a retro-style RPG game set in a post-apocalyptic world with survival and exploration mechanics where resources will have to be managed while exploring the territories, in which there will be different resources and you will have to battle or not different enemies to survive. The main objective of the game is to survive until rescued and is narrated in a diary style.

## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
